- [ ] Prepare DEN 193-gene “complete” data frame [0.01] and perform a similar clustering analysis

- [ ] Create an INT “sister” data frame, based on the 644-gene “complete” data frame [0.001]

- [ ] Rotate ”output_K1.csv” data and fine tune brain_hac() accordingly, to project clusters of voxels instead of genes. Then project voxel clusters onto a 3-D space

- [x] Generate pie charts and bar graphs for chat-252 cluster results

- [x] Incorporate a total voxel count for per cluster in pie chart

- [x] Improve upon color gradient for stacked bar graphs

- [ ] Update brainscan() to display histogram specific to chat-252’s gene expression distribution

- [ ] Plot/identify initial centroids of each cluster for later comparison

- [ ] Implement sub-clustering routine into brain_k-means_cbk() to cluster within specified cluster(s) and pinpoint Structure-IDs within each

- [ ] Update on Project Overview for quarterly progress report and later reference (edited)
